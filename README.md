CJCC -> CJ's C Compiler
=======================

This compiler is a running project, and still quite far from complete. But hey, it's getting there.

I'm writing it to learn about how compilers work, which I have very much been doing as I go. While in
the process, I'm keeping notes in my notes.md file. If you are interested in my thought process as 
I wrote each element, that would be a good place to look. 

Ultimately, I might write a series of blog posts, or even a PDF document that describes my experience,
and serves as a lesson book for others who would like to write their own compilers.

I have found that much of the reference documentation on the subject is either highly theoretical,
incomplete, or simply not was I was looking for (a C compiler in C).

If any of this interestests you or you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am
planning on doing a write up on this process regardless, but if I had anyone whom I knew was interested
I would do it sooner.
